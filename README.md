# Requirements

You need to purchase a legit [Clickteam Fusion 2.5+](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/10632/Standard/) copy to use it. Make sure to install the most recent version of [SDL Joystick](https://github.com/SortaCore/SDLJoystick-priv/releases/), [Scope Control](https://github.com/Uppernate/ScopeControlPublic) and the included shaders to make this works. The latest version is compatible with 292.22 build or higher.

# Terms of Use

You are free to use this framework however you want, as long as you be within our terms of use.

- Credit everyone involved in the development of this project.
- You can use this framework to develop commercial games, as long as you don't use anything protected by copyright in your game (e.g. don't commercialize a game using the Sonic the Hedgehog brand under any circumstances).
- Do not falsely claim that this structure or parts of it are made by you. For example, releasing a reskinned version removing the name of the developers or using parts of the code from this framework in another framework without crediting the author.

# Features

Core was a modified version of Sonic Worlds, but we decided to rewrite it as of version 0.23.0 with significant changes, such as improvements to the collision system, sensors, angle detection, visual angle calculation, landing, ceiling landing and physics.

The base 360 Platform Movement and physics is already finished. The codes were built to be more economical and saving performance. We keep some things from the original base, such as some parts of the movement routine and the actions system using group activation/deactivation, but everything with some rewritting and/or improvements (e.g. the actions which were all rewritten, keeping only the way they are activated and deactivated).

It has support for SDL Joystick, volume control, display options, save system. It also contains alot of gimmicks, items and features to you build your fangame with the most higher standards.

Some things that naturally worked great were ported from Sonic Worlds Delta, like tunnels, screw, corkscrew and breakable floor in with slight adaptations, but everything else was rewritten by us.
