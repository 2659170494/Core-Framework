Core was a modified version of Sonic Worlds in the past, but we decided to rewrite it as of version 0.23.0 with significant changes, such as improvements to the collision system, sensors, angle detection, visual angle calculation, landing, ceiling landing and physics. The code is wrote to be more economical and saving performance. We keep some things from the original base, such as some parts of the movement routine and the actions system using group activation/deactivation, but everything with some rewritting and/or improvements (e.g. the actions which were all rewritten, keeping only the way they are activated and deactivated).

Some things that naturally worked great were ported from Sonic Worlds Delta, like tunnels, screw, corkscrew and breakable floor in with slight adaptations, but everything else was rewritten by us.

Detailed comments have been written for easy understanding.

# Requirements
