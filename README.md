# Core Engine

This is a open-source Sonic engine for _Clickteam Fusion 2.5+_ created by Nihil in association with Tyson Tay, Lighto, Ainand, YohananDiamond, Chopp, Yonatankr, Dark, Joshyflip, Carlos Ushiromiya, Dolphman, Yolkin, Troopsushi, Angeloz, Jeloboi and Nuclear. The engine was built from the Sonic Worlds base (created by Damizean), but it's entire core has been radically modified to offer infinitely greater precision, making Core a unique, cohesive and solid experience.

# Features

The base 360 Platform Movement and physics is already finished. The codes were built to be more economical, saving performance and making it easier for users to understand. An extensive internal documentation was been written, including used groups and math formulas.

Talking about the base, we keep some things from the original base, such as some parts of the movement routine and the actions system using group activation/deactivation, but everything with some rewritting and/or improvements (e.g. the actions which were all rewritten, keeping only the way they are activated and deactivated).

Other important parts like rings, camera, sensors, physics, collision, landing and angle detection, have been completely different. It has support for SDL Joystick, volume control, display options, save system, smooth rotation and classic rotation. It also contains alot of gimmicks, items and features to you build your fangame with the most higher standards.

We've added a gumball machine bonus stage and a unfinished Blue Spheres example created by Yonatankr. Some things that naturally worked great were ported from Sonic Worlds Delta, like the parallax system, tunnels, screw, corkscrew and breakable floor in with slight adaptations, but everything else was rewritten by us..

# Basic usage

Make sure to install the most recent version of [**SDL**](https://github.com/SortaCore/SDLJoystick/releases) to make this works. If the _Global Event Editor_ don't display the variables, don't worry. Just go to Proprieties/Events and check if the base frame is Test Level.

# Documentation
