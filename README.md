# CORE ENGINE

Core is a open-source Sonic engine for Clickteam Fusion 2.5+ created by Nihil in association with Tyson Tay, Lighto, Ainand, YohananDiamond, Chopp, Yonatankr, Dark, Joshyflip, Carlos Ushiromiya, Dolphman, Yolkin, Troopsushi, Angeloz, Jeloboi and Nuclear. The engine was built from the Sonic Worlds base (created by Damizean), but it's entire core has been radically modified to offer infinitely greater precision, making Core a unique, cohesive and solid experience for Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Plus.
